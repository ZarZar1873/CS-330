*How do I approach designing software?
  -What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    I have learned how important proper textures are when creating a virtual world, as well as how important it is that the code itself is properly segregated into functions for easier readability. Having to navigate a giant main function is tedious and waists countless hours.
  -What design process did you follow for your project work?
    For working on my project I followed a linear process. As the weeks progressed I added the new skill of the week to the final product and when it was time for the actual creation I had most of it already made. 
  -How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    I think that alot of the tactics for futur work are found in what I learned I should not do in the future. Working linearly instead of a more agile approach costed me a lot of time, and having such a large main file made my project hard to read a tedious to change.
*How do I approach developing programs?
  -What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I used a lot of prebuilt code, which I was very new to. Learning how to decipher others code taught me how important comments are and how gave me more practice on reviewing other peoples work. I also learned how to cite work in my code so I do not commit plagerism.
  -How did iteration factor into your development?
    This development was nothing but iteration. Each week added a new feature to the scene and when making the scene I would change the location or size of something, run the code, make changes where needed, and then do it all again for the next item I needed to add/change.
  -How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    My approach has changed immensly. I learned to not become dependent on another persons base code (like using an example that was provided during module 3). I ended up having to make sacrifices to my end product. If I had the time I would make a lot of changes to the final program.
*How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    This course gave me knowledge on how to use OpenGL and how to design window popups, and how to work with graphics and textures. This will help me if any course needs that. I also learned about using provided base codes, learning how to do something multiple ways, and deciphering other peoples work. That knowledge will help as many courses do use some premade work to speed up the learning process and allow students to focus on the new information.
  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  My professional goal is to enter a career in software development. Learning how to create complex programs with frames that update constantly as well as implimenting large project folders with multiple CPP files will help me greatly. I also learned a lot about capturing key presses, cursor location, and hiding the mouse cursor.
